The AquaUmoja website is the official website of an aspiring company which looks to provide water and reduce the amount of water bottle littering with a deposit incentive.
The website consists on 4 major pages each created by pairs of group members i.e The Landing Page, The Products Page, The Sign up/Log in Page and lastly the Deposit Page.

1. LANDING PAGE (NATHANIEL AND ROY)

II) Responsivity
  The website is responsive, at  smaller screen sizes the services changes to a column direction and a hamburger menu pops up in the nav.
  Furthermore, the various images assume a column flex direction to fit into smaller screen sizes

III)About section 
  The About section contains a breif description of what aquaumoja is about.

IV) ANIMATIONS
  On loading, the company name and description slide into the screen.
  Furthermore, on scroll sections coming into the viewport fade into the frame.


2. SERVICES (TUMAINI AND YNA)
For the services we have a grid of products that we offer, when one wants to add a product to the cart they can click the add to cart button.
Products added to the cart can be multiplied in the cart itself thus more than one product can also be added to the cart.
Totals are calculated for each product individually.
The page is still responsive and the number of columns in the grid reduces for smaller screen sizes.


3. SIGNUP AND LOGIN (NAKIRA , YAN , MISAAL)
Clicking the sign up page allows the user to create an account which would save their information for future purchases. 
Clicking the user icon allows the user to login into an existing account.
Both pages use Javascript for user validation which ensures all fields are filled and errors are shown if not.


4. DEPOSIT (JEREMY, NIMO)
The deposit page shows a form that allows the user to contact us in order to make a request for a bottle pick up.
After the form is filled all the information is sent to the offical Aquaumoja email which allows us to contact the user personally.
The page also shows the location of the deposit station where the pick up ends up.
